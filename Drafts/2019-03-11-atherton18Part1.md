In November 2018 my friend Matthias, a crazy herpertologist (with many other naturalist lives) came from New Caledonia to look for "lizards" in North Queensland. 
Since I had loved my 2017 trip to the Cape York, had not seen every bird species up there (unsurprisingly), he was planning to visit some areas unknown to me, AND his trip coincided with my 30th birthday, I could not not join for some naturalist adventures.

As you may have guessed from my use of the word "lizards", I don't know much about reptiles. I generally leave those to Matthias and other serious people, but did notice a few rather big ones.
