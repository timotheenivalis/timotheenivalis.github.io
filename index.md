I am a tenured researcher at the French National Centre for Scientific Research, at Centre d'Etudes Biologiques de Chizé (CNRS & La Rochelle Université).

I do research on **recent genetic evolution** and **demography** in wild animal populations. I work with various animals, but I am starting projects focussed on sub-antarctic seabirds, especially albatrosses.

Until January 2023 I was a DECRA fellow at the [Research School of Biology](https://biology.anu.edu.au/) and gave part-time support in statistics and programming within the [Biological Data Science Institute](http://bdsi.anu.edu.au/); both part of the Australian National University in Canberra.

[**Workshops of Bio-Statistics and R-programming** are at https://timotheenivalis.github.io//workshops/](https://timotheenivalis.github.io//workshops/).
