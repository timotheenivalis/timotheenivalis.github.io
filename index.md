I am primarily interested in recent genetic evolution, and what it means for the demography and the fate of wild animal populations. 

I am just starting (Feb 2023, I don't know how it works yet) a permanent position with the French National Centre for Scientific Research, at Centre d'Etudes Biologiques de Chizé (CNRS & La Rochelle Université). I will be working on sub-antarctic seabirds.

Until January 2023 I was a DECRA fellow at the [Research School of Biology](https://biology.anu.edu.au/) and gave part-time support in statistics and programming within the [Biological Data Science Institute](http://bdsi.anu.edu.au/); both part of the Australian National University in Canberra.

[**Workshops of Bio-Statistics and R-programming** are at https://timotheenivalis.github.io//workshops/](https://timotheenivalis.github.io//workshops/).
