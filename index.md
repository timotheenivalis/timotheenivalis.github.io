I am a researcher at the French National Centre for Scientific Research, at Centre d'Etudes Biologiques de Chizé (CNRS & La Rochelle Université).

I do research on **recent genetic evolution** and **demography** in wild animal populations. I work with various animals, but my current projects focus on **albatrosses**.

### Come work with me?

_**I am offering a fully-funded PhD, co-supervised with Christophe Barbraud, on white stork migration and habitat use. Come work with us to analyse GPS, accelerometry, demographic and physiologic data.**_

[Details here](https://timotheenivalis.github.io/Rnotebooks/AAP_AllocDoc_2025_Form_Cigognes_BarbraudBonnetetal_cb_ENGLISH.pdf)

_**Contact me to apply before May 31st 2025 or for information.**_



Get in touch if you would be interested in applying for funding to come do a Post-Doc or PhD with me. Several national, European and international funding bodies could provide appropriate fellowships.
