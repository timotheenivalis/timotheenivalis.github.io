## R-Markdown part of a reproducible workshop

Science is hard enough, do yourself a favor and make it reproducible.

![https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3JldKoA0zw](Figures/markdownyoutube.png)

R-markdown combines the R and Markdown languages using Knitr and is made easier in RStudio. R-markdown let you create a broad range of documents: reports, journal articles, books, (interactive) webpages, blogs, slides.

The ability to create documents with bits of R-code and outputs makes your life easier and promotes reproducible science.

Today we will focus on writing reports. Start by selecting new, R Markdown, Document, HTML. RStudio generates an example. You can see that the file has three components:

* An (optional) YAML header surrounded by - - -s. This sets the configuration and layout.
* R code chunks surrounded by ```s
* Text mixed with simple text formatting

Compile by cliking "Knit" or pressing Ctrl+Shift+K.

## Text: Basics of Markdown syntax

Plain text is just text.

End a line with two spaces  
to start a new line, or leave a blank line to start a new paragraph.

Use \# to create headers. \# for main title, \#\# for section header, \#\#\# for subsection... and so on.

Text between \*italics\*: *italics* or \_italics\_: _italics_

Text between \*\*bold\*\*: **bold** or \_\_bold\_\_: __bold__

Mix \* and \_ for \_\*\*both bold and italics\*\*\_: _**both bold and italics**_

Unordered lists with \*, \+ or \- followed by spaces. Hierarchy is controled by 2-tabs.

Special characters be: \\\* \\\_ \\\\: \* \_ \\

Math model with Latex syntax. 
Equation between \$. \$A = \\pi r\^2\$: $A = \pi r^2$

Equation block between \$\$: $$A = \pi r^2$$

> Block quote  
> second line

Inline verbatim code within backticks (\`): `lm(x ~ y)`

### Lists

* unordered list
    * sub-item 1
    + sub-item 2
    + sub-item 3
    - sub-item 4
        - sub-sub-item 

Ordered lists with 1., i) or A). Hierarchy is controled by 2-tabs:

1. ordered main 1
2. ordered main 2
    i) sub 1
    ii) sub 2
        A) sub-sub item 1
        B) sub-sub item 1
3. ordered main 3

Or create numbering automatically with (\@) to allow breaks:

(@) list that can be interupted item 1
(@) list that can be interupted item 2

Interuption

(@) list that can be interupted item 3


## R chunks

Insert by clicking "Insert R" or Ctrl+Alt+I or starting with 3 backticks followed by curly braces, and ending with 3 backticks.

```{}
x <- rnorm(1000)
plot(x)
```


If you want your code to be interpreted, make the language explicit in the opening curly braces. By default it is r.
```{r}
x <- rnorm(1000)
plot(x)

```

Turn the following code in a .Rmd document and compile it:
```{r, eval=FALSE}
x1 <- rnorm(200)
x2 <- x1 +rnorm(200)
y <- 1 + x1 +rnorm(200)
summary(lm(y ~ x2))
plot(x2, y)

```


### Control chunk behaviour

If you want to show a code that does not work or that would take a long time to run use argument eval=FALSE.

If you want not to show code, use argument echo=FALSE

* collapse= TRUE/FALSE ; combine code and output?
* warning / message / error = TRUE/FALSE ; show what R wants to tell
you?
* include = TRUE/FALSE ; show anything from the chunk in the document?
* fig.width / fig.height ; figure dimensions in inches
* fig.cap ; figure caption
* dev = ’pdf’ / ’png’ / ’svg’ / ’jpeg’ / ’tikz’ /... ; How to create images?

### Inline r-code or r-output

```{r, eval=FALSE}
` 1 + pi `
```
Inline code `1 + pi`.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
`r 1 + pi `
```
Inline code `r 1 + pi`.

## A little bit of YAML (pronounced "Ya-mel", like "Camel")

Warning: YAML is very sensitive to spaces/tabs!

Starts and end with 3 dashes. 
Then, basic information:

* title: "XX"
* author: "XX"
* date: "XX"
* output: html_document / word_document / pdf_document

Try word output, and pdf output if you have a LaTeX distribution.

### Some useful options with html

Add a table of contents (floating or fixed). Pay attention to tabs.
```{}
output:
  html_document:
    toc: true
    toc_float: true
```


Section numbering.
```{}
output:
  html_document:
    number_sections:true
```

Layout: theme and highlight.

**theme:** default, cerulean, journal, flatly, darkly, readable, spacelab,
united, cosmo, lumen, paper, sandstone, simplex, and yeti. Pass null for
no theme (in this case you can use the css parameter to add your own styles)

**highlight:**
default, tango, pygments, kate, monochrome, espresso, zenburn,
haddock, textmate and null

For instance:
```{}
output:
  html_document:
    theme: united
    highlight: tango
```

## More Markdown syntax

### Insert pictures

```{}
![caption](Figures/rmarkdown.jpg)
```


or if you want more control with chunk options, for instance: r, fig.cap="R Markdown logo", fig.width=6

```{r, fig.cap="R Markdown logo", fig.width=6}
knitr::include_graphics("Figures/rmarkdown.jpg")
```


### Insert hyperlink

```{}
[text to show](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/)
```

[text to show](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/)

Or simply an url: https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/


### Insert tables

You can create them manually but probably do not want to:

| Right | Left | Default | Center |
|------:|:-----|---------|:------:|
| 12 | 12 | 12 | 12 |
| 123 | 123 | 123 | 123 |
| 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 |


However knitr makes printing tables easy with kable.
```{r}
data(cars)
head(cars)

knitr::kable(x = head(cars),
     caption = "A knitr kable table", align = c("r","c"), 
     row.names = TRUE)
```


### Insert html tabs with `{.tabset}`

## Linear regression {.tabset}
### Simulations
```{r}
x1 <- rnorm(100)
x2 <- rnorm(100) + 2*x1
y <- x1 - 0.5*x2 +rnorm(100)
```
### Simple
A simple regression measures total associations
```{r}
summary(lm(y ~ x2))
```
### Multiple
A multiple regression measures direct associations, corrected for indirect
associations.
```{r}
summary(lm(y ~ x1+x2))
```
