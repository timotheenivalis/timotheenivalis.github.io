I gave a little talk on using open-source / free software / freeware at the "Ecology and Evolution Tea time (TE&E)". 
I am really not an expert on the topic, but basically I wanted to show that :

* Ubuntu (Linux) is now super user friendly
* Open-source software has major advantages for science
* You can do most stuff with open-source / free software in everyday life
* I really like [Xaringan](https://github.com/yihui/xaringan) to make slides in R-Markdown

[**Here are my slides:** ](http://timotheenivalis.github.io/Rnotebooks/openstuff.html) and 
[here is the code: ](https://github.com/timotheenivalis/OpenStuff_TEE)


And here is the advertisment for the talk written with Putter Tiatragul :

> Entry: At lunch one arvo of a drab winter dayâ€¦

>
> Putter: Tim... why do you only use Linux? Isn't it complicated...and boring?
>
> Tim: Yes and no. With Ubuntu* Linux got really easy. You can use the OS just like Windows or Mac except it doesn't crash and you can customise the computer...
>
> Putter: But how about the flashy software that I use like Photoshop and Office? Don't you miss them?
>
> Tim: Well, there are good free open-source software that do the same things now, and they're continuously getting better... I have not missed anything for years.
>
> Putter: Sounds like you want to tell everyone about freeware and open-science at TE&E?
>
> Tim: Uh, not rea...
>
> Putter: Beauty! I'll sign you up for 2pm in the Evolution Meeting Room on Wednesday the 30th of June!
>
>
> Exit: The lunch conversation drifts back to fascination about obscure wildlife (e.g. little brown birds), how cold it is, prayers for no rain/border closures, themed party ideas, and the best place to fix broken laptops/bikes...
