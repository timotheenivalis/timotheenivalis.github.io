In May 2022 we got an article published in Science : [https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abk0853](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abk0853). 
As these things tend to, the article attracted lots of media attention and for a few weeks I was constantly answering interview requests.
Since I have to report on media coverage for a grant report, I thought I might put a (non-exhaustive) list here :

- [The conversation Australia](https://theconversation.com/wild-animals-are-evolving-faster-than-anybody-thought-183633), re-used in various outlets such as [National Geographic Australia](https://www.australiangeographic.com.au/news/2022/05/talking-about-an-evolution-wild-animals-are-changing-faster-than-anybody-thought/)
- [Eureka Alerts](https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/953928)
- [Yahoo News](https://news.yahoo.com/evolution-could-be-happening-four-times-faster-than-previously-believed-155741851.html?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly9zY2llbmNlLmFsdG1ldHJpYy5jb20vZGV0YWlscy8xMjg5MTI5NTkvbmV3cw&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAJNq1DA4jDISmBffeK0diVzTCR5C19RyS13U20Xkf51DCr5yxgjrFePUNO46j5K6upnzv5F2vdqSxzBXWF8SsecTWS_Tg0pJdMxyk7fd3XFJUYupnXQkC8HcOedlzo0uTtuXCjCbx2vJqeXqhOArGE1dpJdparH8c9UuKRs4Y5Cw)
